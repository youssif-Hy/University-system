Origin
This project was created by Youssef Harby Bayoumi
It is the final project for a training program in collaboration with the Enactus community.

Program Description
This system is designed to be used by both students and university administrators.
	•	Administrators use the system to store and manage student data, which can be retrieved upon request.
	•	Students use the program to register their information or log in to access useful resources such as book links or PDF files available within the system.

Future Goals
The developer hoped to make the system capable of saving data in a dedicated data file, but due to time constraints, this feature has not been implemented yet.
Therefore, the program is still under development and not a complete version as of now.

Update History
	•	Project development started on April 21, 2025
